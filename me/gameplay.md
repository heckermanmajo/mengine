# Mages

You start with a single mage and then
you work your way up by <the gamefeatures>
to own more and more of the map.

After owning the whole map, you then use the 
campaign map to move to the next map.
You can also take some units and resources
with you to the next map.

The conquered map can be attacked by ai or 
some kind of raider events.

The player is in an diplomatic relationship
with all factions. In the rts camp, he has a 
relation ship with the local lords of 
then factions. This translates into the 
relation to the faction as a whole.

You can only build chunks you own.
There are vacant chunks, they cna be 
bought or conquered or get as a reward for 
a quest.

Resources can be harvested, but are limited per
rts game battle.
